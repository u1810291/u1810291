### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
First and foremost, I love writing code. Ever since writing my first program in C++ and manipulating it to produce
a desired output, I have been obsessed with the idea of using software to solve practical problems. Software
engineering is a never-ending puzzle that I am passionately engaged in solving. I believe in the power of
programming to transform and improve the lives of people around the world.
- For my first professional contract with Turonbank, I was given the opportunity to lead a full database management and analyzing
data that contains this database. For managing manipulating these data I have been using PL/SQL, 'Metabase'
opensource platform and python programming language. My second contract involved injecting HTML/CSS/
JavasCript on popular delivery dispatch websites via a browser extension. This contract with Silkroad express
quickly turned into a full time offer and I have been happily expanding my role as a software engineer ever since.
Today, I am middle ReactJs developer at AVTECH working on the frontend into our customer acquisition flow so
that it can be dynamically composed using demographic data and allow for CI/CD deployments to bring features to
market faster.
- Even when I leave the office, I tend to continue wriring code at the house. Most recently I have been working
on a website for my band Colibrisoft. This what keeps me up at night, a never ending thirst to create beautiful,
poweful thinsg and share them with the world.
- Skills/Interests: JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Redux, Webpack/Babel, StyledComponents, Css, HTML, Git,
GirLab, SQL, PostgreSQL, Docker, Python, Django Rest Framework, Gunicorn, Nginx.
